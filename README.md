# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
Welcome to Rogue Hub Plus, Roblox's #1 script hub utility for Slap Battles! Due to Kitzoon temporarily stopping development for Slap Battles support on Rogue Hub, I've decided to continue adding features on my own branch while I can.

# ðŸ’‰ Script
Paste the script into your executor to open Rogue Hub Plus (Slap Battles):
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iSkidYourScripts/Rogue-Hub/main/Main.lua",true))()
```

# ðŸ“· Screenshots
Unfortunately, I can't show the No-Scope Arcade screenie as Rogue Hub Plus is only for Slap Battles.

<br>
# ðŸ§ª Testing
This is a testing branch for newer experimental Rogue Hub features, and is not made by Kitzoon. If you wish to use the original Rogue Hub script, the Github page is linked above. The features used in Rogue Hub Plus are not official and may be buggy at times.

# ðŸ¤“ Skidding Policy
**Good for you,** you decided to skid something. <br>
We can't stop you, but just know you're pathetic. <br>
Atleast, credit Rogue Hub and or Kitzoon for all the <br>
work that has gone into these scripts. Thanks!
