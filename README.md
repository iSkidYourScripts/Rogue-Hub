# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
Welcome to Rogue Hub, Roblox's #1 script hub utility! Whilst Rogue Hub Plus currently adds more features to only Slap Battles, I might add a few other features to more games, if I have the time. Consider joining Rogue Hub's official discord server, linked above, for updates, and more information regarding new game support, etc!

# ðŸ’‰ Script
Paste the script into your executor to open Rogue Hub (original, NOT Rogue Hub Plus):
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kitzoon/Rogue-Hub/main/Main.lua", true))()
```

# ðŸ“· Screenshots
Here are some screenshots showcasing what Rogue Hub is capable of.

# ðŸ§ª Testing
This is a testing branch for newer experimental Rogue Hub features, and is not made by Kitzoon. If you wish to use the original Rogue Hub script, the Github page is linked above. The features used in Rogue Hub Plus are not official and may be buggy at times.

# ðŸ¤“ Skidding Policy
**Good for you,** you decided to skid something. <br>
We can't stop you, but just know you're pathetic. <br>
Atleast, credit Rogue Hub and or Kitzoon for all the <br>
work that has gone into these scripts. Thanks!
